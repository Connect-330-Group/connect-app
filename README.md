# connect-app

Our findings show that, from our small yet diverse sample of Northwestern students, many students feel disconnected from the 
people closest to them to varying degrees. However, all of our insights showed that they express a desire to value these 
connections more by staying in touch. We found through our user interviews that the biggest obstacles to this challenge 
include busyness from schoolwork, a desire to stay focused from distractions (such as texts/messaging), and finding time that
both the user and who they want to contact are free to talk. Users appear to be motivated to talk to those they care about 
when it is convenient, when they have a major life update or issue to share, or when they are coordinating plans.
